# Autonomous-Cars-Project -- Udacity

This repository contains the files that I worked on during my summer research internship at the Center of Cyber Security at NYU Abu Dhabi. 

<h2>Purpose</h2>
The purpose of this research project was to identify vulnerabilities in autonomous car systems, by looking into open-source self-driving car simulators, such as the <a href = "https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Behavioral-Cloning-P3"> Udacity Behavioral Cloning project </a>. The project explored the cyber security of these sources by implementing attacks such as the one-pixel attack, that tampered with the output (images) produced by the neural network of the self-driving car.

<h2>Udacity Behavioral Cloning Project</h2>
The project consists of a simulator that is able to emulate a self-driving car, by provind two user modes:
<h4>Training</h4>
<h4>Autonomous Mode</h4>
All the code is uploaded to the Attack folder. More explanations for how the code works are in my last presentations (Week 7 & 8). 

The instructions for how to install the Udacity self-driving car simulator are in the document under Resources. You can find all the papers referenced in that document too.
