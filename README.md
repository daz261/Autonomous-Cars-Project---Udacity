# Autonomous-Cars-Project -- Udacity

This repository contains the files that I worked on during my summer research internship at the Center of Cyber Security at NYU Abu Dhabi. 

<b>Purpose</b>
All the code is uploaded to the Attack folder. More explanations for how the code works are in my last presentations (Week 7 & 8). 

The instructions for how to install the Udacity self-driving car simulator are in the document under Resources. You can find all the papers referenced in that document too.
